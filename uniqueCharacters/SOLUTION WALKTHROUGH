SOLUTION-1: (my own)
  1. For counting unique characters, we will keep a counter named as 'count' initialised to 1.
  2. Select each character in the string (starting from 2nd character as the first character in the string will be unique always)
     and check all the previous characters starting from first character till one character behind our selector
     (to check the previous characters we'll keep a checker)
     to know if there's any same character present in the string other at other position. 
     --> if same character present : select next character
     --> if not : check if the checker has reached just behind the selector
                    --> reached behind : increase our counter by one
                    --> not reached : DO NOTHING
